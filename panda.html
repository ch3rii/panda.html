            <p style="font-family:garamond; text-align:center">Pandas live mainly in <b> temperate forests </b> high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around <b> 26 to 84 pounds </b> of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>

            <h2 id="poopoo" style="color:#483D8B">THREATS</h2>
            <h4>Habitat Loss</h4>
            <p>China’s Yangtze Basin region holds the panda’s primary habitat. Infrastructure development (such as dams, roads, and railways) is increasingly isolating panda populations, preventing pandas from finding new bamboo forests and potential mates. Forest loss also reduces pandas’ access to the bamboo they need to survive. The Chinese government has established more than 50 panda reserves, but only around 67% of the total wild panda population lives in reserves, with 54% of the total habitat area being protected.</p>
            <h4>Hunting</h4>
            <p>Although poaching impacted pandas in the past, its impact declined since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act (1988), which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, pandas may get caught accidentally in snares set for musk deer or other species.</p>
        <h2 id="#gulag" style="color:#483D8B">FACTS</h2>
        <p>Status: Vulnerable</p>
        <p>Population: 1,864</p>
        <p>Scientific name: Ailuropoda melanoleuca</p>
        <p>Height: Adults can grow to over 4 feet</p>
        <p>Weight: 220-330 pounds</p>
        <p>Habitats: Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of southwest China</p>
        <h2 id="#wawa" style="color:#483D8B">ROLE IN NATURE</h2>
        <p>The biological diversity of the panda’s habitat is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems, making the giant panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other species where pandas live. In other words, when we protect pandas, we invariably protect other animals that live around them, such as multicolored pheasants, the golden monkey, takin, and crested ibis. Pandas also bring sustainable economic benefits to many local communities through ecotourism.</p>
